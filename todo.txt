  -Implement authentication in your application.
    Assignment: Choose and implement one of the authentication methods we covered in class:
      JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
      OAuth 2.0
    Important: You must implement the authentication logic from scratch without using ready-made authentication libraries. This will help you understand how these protocols work under the hood.

# 🗂️ Loan Simulator Roadmap Checklist

## 🔹 Phase 1: Finalize Core Module
- [ ] **Add summary object to early repayment logic**
  - [ ] Include total interest saved
  - [ ] Include adjusted loan duration
- [ ] **Validate full vs early repayment totals**
  - [ ] Compare principal + interest across scenarios
  - [ ] Ensure consistency with amortization schedule
- [ ] **Write unit tests for edge cases**
  - [ ] Zero interest rate
  - [ ] Very short loan duration
  - [ ] Early repayment at final period

## 🔹 Phase 2: Comparison & Simulation
- [ ] **Implement `compareLoans()` function**
  - [ ] Accept multiple loan configs
  - [ ] Return ranked summary by cost, duration, flexibility
- [ ] **Add `simulateEarlyRepayments()` for multiple periods**
  - [ ] Support custom repayment schedules
  - [ ] Visualize impact over time
- [ ] **Prepare data structure for frontend charts**
  - [ ] Monthly breakdowns
  - [ ] Cumulative totals
  - [ ] Interest vs principal split

## 🔹 Phase 3: Frontend Prep
- [ ] **Sketch UI components**
  - [ ] Loan input form
  - [ ] Results table
  - [ ] Interactive chart
- [ ] **Decide on chart library**
  - [ ] Chart.js (simple, responsive)
  - [ ] D3.js (custom, powerful)
- [ ] **Plan localization**
  - [ ] Currency formatting
  - [ ] Language support
  - [ ] Regional loan norms

## 🧠 Notes
- Keep logic pure and config-driven
- Avoid premature optimization — build for clarity first
- Modularize functions for reuse in future products


🔤  Glossary:
    -ratePerPeriod: Interest rate applied each compounding period
    -totalAmount: Final amount the user repays (principal + interest)
    -interestAccrued: Total interest paid over the loan term
    -Lump Sum: single large payment made at once.
