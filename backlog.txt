  -Implement authentication in your application.
    Assignment: Choose and implement one of the authentication methods we covered in class:
      -JWT (JSON Web Tokens) (chosen)
      -OAuth 2.0
    Important: You must implement the authentication logic from scratch without using ready-made 
      authentication libraries. This will help you understand how these protocols 
      work under the hood. (login process pending)
  -Create DB schema as diagram. In your application u should have at list 3 DB tables.
  -Your task is to implement the database you designed in your diagram by creating executable SQL scripts.
    It can be any SQL database. If you don't know which to use - I recommend to use PostgreSQL.
    Requirements:
      -Create a comprehensive SQL script (.sql file) that generates all tables, relationships, indexes,
        and constraints from your database diagram
