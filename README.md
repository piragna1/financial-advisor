### Overview
The main idea is to help me (and maybe others) learn the basics of managing personal finances with some simple tools and calculators. Since I‚Äôm still learning, the features are pretty basic, and I‚Äôm figuring things out as I go. The application lets users try out different financial strategies and see how their decisions might affect their money over time. It‚Äôs a work in progress, and I hope to improve it as I learn more!
## 
### Task Description
**Personal Finance Advisor**: Create a financial advisor application. Users can input their salary, preferred currency, and desired annual interest rate. The system calculates the maximum loan amount they can obtain, the repayment plan, and the total interest paid over the loan term.
##
### Summary
This loan simulation system that handles JWT authentication, works connected to a database, can be reconstructed with Docker and handles http requests through an api.
##
### Authentication
This system uses JWT authentication process with tokens.
#### Sign up
Send POST request to http://localhost:3000/auth/register  with the corresponded information in order to successfully sign up to the system. See the following example:

{
    "name":"Gonzalo",
    "lastName":"Varela Alagna",
    "email":"gvalagna@gmail.com",
    "password":"gvalagnA$4"
}

      user: {
        id: "u1",
        email: "gvalagna@example.con",
      },
    }

    
#### Sign in

  "password": "gvalagnA$4"
}

DB_NAME=prestamos_db
```
These variables are used in src/config/db.config.js or its equivalent.

#### Troubleshooting
